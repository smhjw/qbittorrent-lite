## Build (Using Local Toolchain in `tools/`)

This project can be built with the bundled toolchain under:

- `tools/android-build/tools/jdk17`
- `tools/android-build/tools/android-sdk`

PowerShell example:

```powershell
$env:JAVA_HOME="D:\hjw\codex\qb-remote-android\tools\android-build\tools\jdk17"
$env:ANDROID_HOME="D:\hjw\codex\qb-remote-android\tools\android-build\tools\android-sdk"
$env:ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=$env:ANDROID_HOME
$env:PATH="$env:JAVA_HOME\bin;$env:ANDROID_HOME\platform-tools;$env:PATH"

.\gradlew.bat assembleDebug
```

APK output:

- `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

If you want a custom filename:

```powershell
Rename-Item "app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk" "qbremote.apk"
```

Release AAB for Google Play:

1. Copy `keystore.properties.example` to `keystore.properties` and fill your signing values.
2. Set `RELEASE_KEY_SHA256` to your upload key certificate fingerprint (recommended).
3. Build:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat bundleRelease
```

Output:

- `app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

Quick script:

```powershell
.\scripts\build-release-aab.ps1
```

The script verifies signing SHA256 before packaging and fails fast if the configured key changes.

## qBittorrent WebUI Setup

---

1. Open `Tools -> Options -> Web UI`
2. Enable `Web User Interface (Remote control)`
3. Set the WebUI port (default `8080`)
4. Set username/password
5. Ensure LAN/WAN firewall rules allow access from your Android device

## Roadmap

- Batch operations for multi-selection
- More tracker/peer/file advanced controls
- Stronger release automation (CI + signed builds)
- More test coverage (ViewModel and repository layers)
